## Neuron Model Folder

These two notebooks show the foundation for the nueron model I use in the project. Most of the information about this section of the project can either be found in the notebooks or the wiki page.

The single junction notebook is just looking at a single component, uncoupled. It shows numerical solutions to its equations and represents pendulum like behaviour with two parameters to chancge, damping and current.

The single nueron notebook connects two junctions together like a coupled pendulum and it exhibits neuron-like behaviour. It fire, then enters a refractory period where it cannot fire again despite being constantly driven.
