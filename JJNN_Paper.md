# General Breakdown of the Project Tasks:

## Task 1: Research, background, physics

* Derive underlying model for JJ via damped oscillation

* $\ddot{\phi}+\Gamma\dot{\phi}+sin{(\phi)}=i$ (does not have analytic solution)

* Euler's Method to get numerical solution is sufficient

* Coupling the Equations to create a firing neuron

* Create Basic Neural Network

* Why? - JJ's are faster at simulating bio-NN's than standard circuitry

## Task 2: Implementation

* Code the single junction

* Code the single neuron

* Connection

* Network

## Task 3: Presentation

* Readme

* Wiki

* Video
