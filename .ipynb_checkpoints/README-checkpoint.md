# Josephson_Junction_Neuromorphic-Raspi4-

This repository is for the development of a simple nueral network by the simulation of Josephson Junctions arranged to form neurons that mimic biology. This project was done specifically on the Raspberry Pi 4. This repository makes use of only a few very common libraries just as Numpy and Matplotlib. The code should be able to run on almost any Python 3 compiler with some the code in a Jupyter Notebook format for ease of showcasing results. Just make sure that the path to the jj.py file is added to the jupyter path because my raspberry pi 4 was defaulting to a different folder. You can simply edit the sys.path.append line in my files for the easiest solution.
